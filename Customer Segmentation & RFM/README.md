# Customer Segmentation & RFM
 
## Description

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets, improving communication, product development, customer relationships, and profitability.

Customer segmentation can be practiced by all businesses regardless of size or industry, and whether they sell online or in person. It begins with gathering and analyzing data and ends with acting on the information gathered in a way that is appropriate and effective.
### Objectives:

- Understand why and when customer segmentation is used.
- Understand RFM analysis and calculation.
- Learn and practice RFM in SQL/spreadsheets.

## Project Overview
This project delves into customer segmentation and buying behavior analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique. The RFM dataset provided information about customer invoices, including:

- Purchase date
- Purchased items
- Quantity of purchased products
- Purchase amount
- Purchase location

By analyzing this data, we aimed to:

- Segment customers based on their buying habits using RFM analysis.
- Gain insights into the buying behavior within each customer segment.
- Develop targeted recommendations for each segment to increase customer engagement.

### Key Questions Addressed
This analysis focused on answering two crucial business questions:

1. **How do our segmented customer groups perform?** Identifying which segments require the most attention is essential.
2. **What recommendations can we develop for each segment to boost engagement?** Tailored strategies are key for maximizing customer engagement.

Further details on the analysis process, segmentation results, and recommendations for each customer group can be found in the following section:

- **Analysis & Reports**: This section provides a detailed report and interactive dashboard that visualize the customer segmentation findings.

### Dataset
This analysis leverages the "rfm" dataset stored within the "turing_data_analytics" database on the Turing College BigQuery project. This dataset contains customer transaction data used for the RFM analysis.

Specifically, we utilized one year of data encompassing the period from December 1st, 2010 to November 30th, 2011 (inclusive).

## Analysis & Report
This repository explores customer segmentation and buying behavior using RFM analysis.  The findings are presented in the following formats:

- [Customer Segmentation Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13PWzJwHSN5S251hizYfTP58Wj9NpF6RhUujUGdbloDk/edit?usp=sharing): This report provides a step-by-step breakdown of the RFM analysis process, explains how customers were segmented based on buying habits, and delivers key insights about each customer group. These insights can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.
- [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nikolina.beric/viz/RFMDashboard_17043026592560/Dashboard1?publish=yes): This interactive dashboard visually represents the customer segmentation data. You can explore the data by segment to gain a clearer understanding of customer behavior patterns within each group.
